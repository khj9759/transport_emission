# Vehicles emission affects to the climate change

### Introduction

During the industrial revolution, the pervasive utilization of fossil fuels has significantly contributed to the escalation of greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the adverse effects of global warming. Various factors have led to the surge in these emissions, with transportation accounting for a substantial one-third share, marking it as the primary contributor to the highest emissions recorded in 2021, as per the Environmental Protection Agency's findings. The objective of this report is to scrutinize the potential of fossil fuels in powering transportation within the United States and to evaluate a proposal by the U.S. government that suggests a partial departure from the standards aimed at curbing fuel consumption, consequently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To mitigate dependence on foreign oil reserves, the United States implemented [Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy) standards in the 1975, mandating each corporation selling passenger cars in the country to attain improved average emission efficiency.

These two models signifies the influence of the implementation of CAFE regulations on the reduction of CO2 emissions from vehicles and overall temperature. As these regulations were initiated in 1975, a waiting interval was factored in to enhance accuracy before analyzing the trend, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the regulation's effect on CO2 emission trends from number of vehicles.

$$\text{Ave. Earth surface Temperature} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{emisson from transport} + \epsilon$$

$$\text{Emission per car} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \text{Year since Regulation} + \beta_3 \text{Number of Car} + \epsilon$$

$\beta_0$ represents the intercept term.

$\beta_1$ is the coefficients indicating the relationship between motor vehicles CO2 emissions by average annual temperature respectively.

$\beta_2$ is the coefficients indicating effect of an additional year since CAFE on CO2 emission savings.

$\beta_3$ is the coefficients indicating the relationship between number of car on the emission per car holding year.

$\epsilon$ is the error term accounting for unexplained variability in the model.

## Analysis

### **Linear Regression Model: Earth's Surface Temperature and Emissions from Transport**

The linear regression model examining the relationship between Earth's surface temperature and emissions from transport is represented as:

$$\text{Ave. Earth surface Temperature} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{emisson from transport} + \epsilon$$

#### Plot

In this plot, earth temperature increase when increasing of emission from transport. There are significat error with Omitted variables shows from other sector emission including industry, and power plants.

```{r}
# Create a line plot to visualize the relationship between transportation emissions and Earth surface temperature over the years

# Define the plot using ggplot
temp_per_emssion_by_year <- ggplot(final, aes(x = transport_emission, y = temp)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Transportation Emission", y = "Earth Surface Temperature", title = "Emission per Temperature (from 1975)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
temp_per_emssion_by_year

```

These findings suggest that around 32% of the variability in transportation emissions can be explained by Earth surface temperature. This aligns with our scatter plot, depicting a consistently strong positive relationship. The favorable F-statistics and low p-values further indicate that the model provides a good fit to the data.

```{r}
# Fit a linear regression model
temp_transport_emission_regres <- lm(temp ~ transport_emission, data = final_subset)

# Display a summary of the regression analysis
summary(temp_transport_emission_regres)

```

### **Linear Regression Model: Emission per car and Year since Regulation**

This model defines the how CAFE regulation effects to the transportation emission. This model explains the vehicle emission effects on CAFE regulation with number of vehicle.

$$\text{Emission per car} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \text{Year since Regulation} + \epsilon$$

In this plot, emission per car decreasing since regulation started. There was no omitted variable in this model. Based on this information, we would like to how regulation affects on overall transport emission. This model proves that the model shows the interaction between the regulation and number of the car affects on the emission per car. Year since regulation and number of car are independent variables, but it is depended on emission per car variable.

```{r}
# Create a line plot using ggplot for 'emission_per_car' from the filtered data
one_car_per_emission<- ggplot(final_subset, aes(x = year, y = Real_World_CO2_g_mi)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "emission per car",
       title = "emission per car by year") +
  theme_minimal()

one_car_per_emission
```

### Model without Interaction: Total CO2 emission saving

$$\text{emission per car} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \text{year since regulation} + \beta_3 \text{number of car} + \epsilon$$

$\beta_0$: The predicted emission per car before the regulation is 476 grams per mile (mi/g).

$\beta_2$: The emissions per car decrease by 5 grams per mile for every year since the regulation, holding the number of cars constant. The coefficient β₂ can be interpreted as the effect of an additional year since the regulation was implemented on emission savings or reduction of emission.

$\beta_3$: This coefficient represents the estimated change in emission per car for each additional unit in the "number of car" variable while holding "year since regulation" constant. It implies that as the number of cars increases, overall emission is increasing.

#### Plot

```{r}
# Create a scatter plot with a regression line
ggplot(final_subset, aes(x = year, y = Real_World_CO2_g_mi)) +
  geom_jitter() +  # Scatter plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "blue") +  # Regression line
  labs(x = "Year Since Regulation", y = "Emission per Car", title = "Regression Plot") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this analysis, p-value is 9.1e-9, which is \< 0.05 can reject null hypothesis. R square is pretty low, which is 0.5.

```{r}
## Convert 'year' to (year - 1974): Year in 1975 becomes 1.
final_subset$years <- final_subset$year - 1974

## Fit a linear model without interaction
model_not_int <- lm(Real_World_CO2_g_mi ~ years + number_of_car, data = final_subset) %>%
  tab_model()
model_not_int
```

### Interaction model: Total CO2 emission saving

$$\text{emission per car} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \text{year since regulation} + \beta_3 \text{number of car} +\beta_4 \text{year since regulation x number of car} + \epsilon$$

$\beta_4$: This is interaction term implies the influence of the number of car on emission per car slightly changes as the year since regulation starts and it is defined the barometer of total CO2 emission saving.

Decreasing the p-value compared to two models suggests that the interaction model between the year since regulation and the number of cars rejects the notion that their combined effect has no impact on understanding variations in CO2 emissions per car. Additionally, the higher $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ values signify that this interaction model better fits the data and captures a greater proportion of the variability in emissions compared to the model without the interaction term.

```{r}
## Fit a linear model with interaction
model_int <- lm(Real_World_CO2_g_mi ~ years + number_of_car + years:number_of_car, data = final_subset)

## Display summary statistics for the model with interaction
model_int %>% summary()

# Create a table (decimal points may not be visible)
# model_int %>%
#   tab_model()
```

### Logit regression using Categorical response variable: New and Old Vehicle

We will further study the new vehicles have effectively reducing emission. This is the showing two plots, which old vehicle before 2000 year model, and new vehicle after 2000 year model with the linear line.

$$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{car per emission} + \beta_2 \times \text{Model} + \varepsilon $$

```{r}
# Create a new variable 'new_brand' based on the year
# Filter the dataset to include only "Car" and "Truck" in Regulatory_Class
final_vehicle_type <- final %>% 
  mutate(new_brand = ifelse(year > 2000, 'new', 'old')) %>%
  filter(Regulatory_Class %in% c("Car", "Truck"))

# Create a jitter plot to show CO2 emissions and new/old classification
ggplot(data = final_vehicle_type, aes(y = new_brand, x = Real_World_CO2_g_mi)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(x = "CO2 Emission per Car", y = "Brand New") +
  theme_minimal()

```

This involves showcasing two plots: one for older vehicles predating the year 2000 model and another for newer vehicles following the 2000 model year, each presented with a linear trend line.

```{r}
# Create a binary variable 'brand_new' based on 'new_brand'
final_vehicle_type <- final_vehicle_type %>%
  mutate(brand_new = ifelse(new_brand == "new", 1, 0))

# Create a jitter plot to visualize CO2 emissions and brand new classification
binary <- ggplot(data = final_vehicle_type, aes(y = brand_new, x = Real_World_CO2_g_mi)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "CO2 Emission per Car", y = "Brand New") 
binary
```

The odds ratio of 0.99 indicates that for each one-unit increase in the 'emission per car' there is an approximate 1% reduction in emissions for newer vehicle models compared to older ones, tending to exhibit approximately 1% lower emissions concerning their CO2 levels compared to older models. This association highlights the potential for newer vehicle models to contribute slightly less to CO2 emissions in real-world scenarios compared to their older counterparts.

```{r}
# Create a logistic regression model for predicting 'brand_new'
mod_new_car <- glm(brand_new ~ Real_World_CO2_g_mi, data = final_vehicle_type, family = 'binomial') 

# Display the summary statistics for the logistic regression model
# mod_new_car %>% summary()

# Create a table summarizing the logistic regression model
mod_new_car %>% tab_model()
```

### Visualizing logistic regression

This is combining two models: linear regression model and logistic regression model, proving insight into both linear and non-linear relationships between old and new vehicles variables.

```{r}
# Create a binary plot with linear and logistic regression lines
ggplot(data = final_vehicle_type, aes(y = brand_new, x = Real_World_CO2_g_mi)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(x = "CO2 Emission per Car", y = "Brand New") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear regression line
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE, color = "red", 
              method.args = list(family = "binomial"))  # Add logistic regression line in red
```

### Logistic regression: Truck and Car

In the context of environmental impact and vehicle emissions, there's a growing concern about the differences in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per mile between different types of vehicles. To evaluate and address these concerns, a statistical analysis is conducted to compare the mean CO2 emissions per mile between two categories of vehicles: cars and trucks. This analysis aims to determine whether there's a significant difference in CO2 emissions per mile between these vehicle types.

$$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{car per emission} + \beta_2 \times \text{Truck} + \varepsilon $$

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model
mod <- glm(brand_new ~ Real_World_CO2_g_mi + Regulatory_Class, 
           data = final_vehicle_type, family = binomial)

# Extract coefficients, exponentiate, and tidy the results
exp(coef(mod)) 
```

The coefficient related to 'Regulatory_ClassTruck' in the logistic regression model indicates an interesting finding. It suggests that the odds of a brand new car reducing its emissions are approximately 22 times higher compared to trucks. This translates to an approximate decrease of emissions by 2.8% in a new truck model compared to older models. This suggests that trucks have not significantly improved their efficiency over the span of nearly 50 years.

This finding aligns with EPA's [Clean Truck Plan](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/clean-trucks-plan), unveiled on August 5, 2021. The plan aims to curb greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. It outlines a series of three rulemakings that will come into effect for heavy-duty engines and vehicles starting from the model year 2027.

### Hypothesis to comparing two models: Car and Truck

$$H_{0}: \mu_{car} - \mu_{Truck} = 0$$

$$H_{A}: \mu_{car} - \mu_{Truck} \neq 0$$

The p-value of 2.22e-14 is less than any commonly used significance level (such as 0.05), indicating strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is strong evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference in CO2 emissions per mile between the car and truck.

There is a 95% confidence that the range between 84.8 and 127.7 includes the true difference in CO2 emissions per mile between cars and trucks.

```{r}
# Separate data into 'Car' and 'Truck' groups
car <- final %>% filter(Regulatory_Class == "Car")
truck <- final %>% filter(Regulatory_Class == "Truck")

# Conduct a t-test to compare CO2 emissions between 'Car' and 'Truck' groups
t_test_result <- t.test(truck$Real_World_CO2_g_mi, car$Real_World_CO2_g_mi, conf.level = 0.95)
# Uncomment the next line to display the summary statistics using tab_model
t_test_result 
```
