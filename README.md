## Vehicles emission affects to the climate change

This report aims to assess the potential of fossil fuels for U.S. transportation and evaluate a government proposal to modify fuel consumption standards, potentially reducing emissions. The implementation of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards in 1975 mandated improved emission efficiency for passenger cars, and analyzing two models demonstrates the impact of CAFE regulations on CO2 reduction and temperature, factoring in a waiting period for accurate trend evaluation since their initiation.


### Purpose
Investigate the impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards on the effective reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additionally, compare the emission efficiencies of truck and car models in relation to these standards.


## Highlights
- Linear regression
- Multi-linear regression
- Interaction model
- Logit regression
- Null Hypothesis
